I can also clarify the different types of AI, such as Narrow AI, General AI, and Super AI. For example, Narrow AI is designed to perform a narrow task, such as facial recognition or internet searches; General AI has the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do; and Super AI refers to AI that possesses intelligence surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds in practically every economically valuable work"
